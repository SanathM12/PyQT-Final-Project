# The main objective for this project is to be able to integrate our Python knowledge into controlling and interacting with embedded systems

# In order to count this project as successful, a few requirements we intend to reach are:
#   PyQt GUI to read in and display the current temperature readings from the Arduino
#   Active control from the GUI to the Arduino for fan control
#   Automated fan toggle based on sensor input and predetermined temperature thresholds
#   Data storage and visualization using MatPlotLib to show the temperature trend over time

# Packages:
#   PyQt for GUI
#   PySerial for Arduino communication
#   MatPlotLib for creating temperature data graphs

# Functionality from Project Proposal: 
#   Bang Bang control to turn on/off fan, variable control to maintain temperature, emergency response control with lighter
